The logo.blend file contains both versions of the logo in seperate scenes.

The mataral for the LASMA letters is complex and has multiple shaders using
mutliple functions.  It essentially computes the distance from the heat and
using an inverse square calculates the temperature for the blackbody
function and strenth for the emmission shader.  Another shader is used to
give the letters a slight glossly surface.
