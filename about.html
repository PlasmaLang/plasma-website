<h2>About</h2>

<p>
We believe that strong static typed, pure functional programming (FP) has a lot
to offer in terms of software reliability and performance.
However it has a well-deserved reputation for being difficult to learn for
newcomers.
FP can also be difficult to use for experienced functional programmers.
</p>

<p>
Multicore computing is ubiquitous,
and other promising parallel architectures either available or on the
horizon;
we believe that it is necessary that parallel and concurrent programming is
available and straight forward.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>
Plasma hopes to address these challenges with the following goals.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      To combine <span class="hl">declarative</span> and
      <span class="hl">imperative</span> programming features.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will combine the safety and reasoning power of strongly typed pure
      FP with a familiar imperative-like syntax.
      We will support
      loops, arrays and other imperative programming features.
      This benefits both experienced developers and novices.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simplicity</p>

    <p>
      Keeping things simple is an excellent engineering practice.
      It also makes the language and tools easier to understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plasma will have a reduced emphasis and dependence on abstract
      concepts like monads.
      They're still supported, but now they can be <span class="hl">learnt
      gradually</span>.
      Many <a href="docs/plasma_ref.html#_Interfaces">interfaces</a>
      will have more sensible names, eg:
      <code>Mappable</code> rather than <code>Functor</code>.
      We will also aim for good tooling and a
      consistent syntax;
      things that <span class="hl">are</span> different will
      <span class="hl">look</span> different.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Excellent <span class="hl">parallelism</span> and
      <span class="hl">concurrency</span> support.</p>

    <p>
      Channels, mvars, semaphores, streams, futures and software
      transactional memory provide safer abstractions than traditional
      threads and locks concurrency.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="hl">Deterministic parallelism</span>
      makes parallelism available without constraining the structure of
      your program or affecting its declarative semantics,
      eg: Haskell's <code>par</code> function or
      <span class="hldef">strategies</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="hl">Automatic parallelism</span> introduces
      deterministic parallelism as a compiler optimisation.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Features</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Declaratively pure</dt>
<dd>helping programmers more confidently understand their
programs, making debugging easier.
Purity also makes it easier to apply many optimisations including automatic
parallelisation.
Plasma uses a <i>resource</i> system to make effects safe.
Resources are composable unlike monads.
</dd>
<dt>A strong, static type system</dt>
<dd>supporting ADTs, parametric polymorphism,
  <a href="docs/plasma_ref.html#_INterfaces">interfaces</a>
  and type inference.</dd>
<dt>Eagerly evaluated.</dt>
<dd>Eager evaluation makes performance and other behaviours more
predictable.</dd>
<dt>Direct support for loops</dt>
<dd>for map, reduce, filter and combinations.
Loops work on different aggregate types.
See <a href="docs/plasma_ref.html#_Loops">Loops in the reference manual</a>.
</dd>
<dt>Bytecode and native code</dt>
<dd>Generic token-based bytecode interpreter,
in the future more optimal bytecode interpreters for each major platform.
and hopefully native code generation.
<dt>Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</dt>
<dd>Interoperability with C.
<dt>Multiple concurrency abstractions</dt>
<dd>Tasks, channels, mvars, futures and STM.
<dt>Manual and automatic parallelisation</dt>
<dd>Parallelise programs based on data-flow, loops and possibly pipelines
either by adding annotations or automatically.
