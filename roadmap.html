<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>
We will measure our progress towards a stable and mostly feature complete
release using several milestones;
each of which is broken into a number of tasks.
</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<p>
The first milestone, "Hello World", is simply the implementation of a basic
runtime, bytecode interpreter and compiler that is capable of compiling and
executing a hello world program.
Although there are many rough edges, this milestone is now complete, and the
rough edges have been moved to our <a href="docs/todo.html">TODO list</a>.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the second and third milestones, are to be able to
demonstrate the kind of language that Plasma will eventually become,
and allow developers to "get a feel" for the language.
The second milestone, "Language Groundwork", covers the kinds of features that
form the basics of the language, and any groundwork that's required for more
advanced features or may constrain later features.
The third milestone, "Nebula", is where the excitement begins
it will introduce parallelism and concurrency and features that are unique
to Plasma.
</p>

{% include functions/show_roadmap.html start=2 roadmap=site.data.roadmap2 %}

<p>
The remaining milestones represent steps towards a stable release.
While we're revising all the milestones as we go, milestones 5 and onwards
are the most-likely milestones to change.
