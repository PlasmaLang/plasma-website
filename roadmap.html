<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>
We will measure our progress towards a stable and mostly feature complete
release using several milestones;
each of which is broken into a number of tasks.
</p>

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<p>
The first milestones represent the groundwork in getting the project started
and the basics working.
The second, "Language Groundwork", sets up many required features like the
type and resource systems which are critical to making further changes work.
</p>

{% include functions/show_roadmap.html roadmap=site.data.roadmap1 %}

<p>
The goal of next few milestones, is to be able to demonstrate the kind of
language that Plasma will eventually become,
and allow developers to "get a feel" for the language.
These milestones is where the excitement begins:
they will introduce parallelism, concurrency and features that are unique to
Plasma.
</p>

{% include functions/show_roadmap.html start=3 roadmap=site.data.roadmap2 %}

<p>
The remaining milestones represent steps towards a stable release.
While we're revising all the milestones as we go, milestones 7 and onwards
are the most-likely milestones to change.
</p>
